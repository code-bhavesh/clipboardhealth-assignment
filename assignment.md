Eplanation 
- Created a linear flow in the code to go through
- Simplified the condition and removed unneded condition like checking for string typeof candidate !== "string", sine the result before would always be a string if candidate exist and boiled down to the core logic of generating the hash
- Following the best practices like usingmodule.exports for exporting instead of exports.functionName
- Moved constants outside the function, making them reusable.

All the above points helped in making code more readable and maintainable.
